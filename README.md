## 1. INTRODUCTION

<p align="justify">
The objective of this study is to develop a machine learning model that utilizes bio-signals to accurately predict the smoking status of an individual. By leveraging AI and machine learning techniques, aim to provide a reliable tool for identifying individuals who are smokers or non-smokers. This predictive model can aid in the development of effective smoking cessation strategies and interventions, ultimately contributing to improved public health outcomes. The model will consider various bio-signals, such as physiological, behavioral, or environmental factors, to achieve accurate and reliable predictions. The goal is to create a practical and accessible solution that can assist healthcare professionals in assessing an individual's smoking status and provide personalized recommendations for smoking cessation.
